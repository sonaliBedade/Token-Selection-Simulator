# Token-Selection-Simulator

This is an interactive Token Sampling Simulator built using Streamlit. The application allows users to experiment with different sampling techniques used in language models (LLMs) to generate text.

Access the app here - https://token-selection-sampling-methods.streamlit.app/

Sampling Techniques:
- Greedy Search
- Beam Search
- Simple Random Sampling
- Top-k Sampling
- Top-p Sampling (Nucleus Sampling)
- Systematic Sampling
- Stratified Sampling
- Temperature Sampling (Low, Medium, High)
- Cluster Sampling
- Best of n Sampling

Users can adjust parameters like k, p, temperature, and n to see how different sampling techniques affect token selection.
